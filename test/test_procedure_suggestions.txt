1. Test the initialization process:

- Verify that the serial communication is properly initialized.
- Check if the "Initializing..." message is printed correctly.
- Ensure that the display setup and PID setup functions are called.

2. Test the main loop:

- Simulate serial input and verify if the serialListen function is called.
- Test the reading of the flow rate and check if the readFlowRate function is called.
- Verify if the PID control is executed by checking if the runPID function is called.
- Test the serial streaming and check if the serialStream function is called.
- Verify if the display is updated by checking if the updateDisplay function is called.
- Ensure that there is a delay of 5 milliseconds between iterations.
